This folder contains the Behavior Driven Development for our development project. It was set up using PyCharm Community 2022.3.3, Python 3.11, Behave 1.2.6, and Gherkin plugin for PyCharm.

To have the feature files to work correctly, you must have the webdriver for Chrome placed correctly in your Python library. If you are placing it in a specific folder, you must specify
the folder in the step labeled "a user launches Chrome" in tests/BDDforDevelopmentProject/features/steps/steps.py
