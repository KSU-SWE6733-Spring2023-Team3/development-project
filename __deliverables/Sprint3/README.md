# Sprint 2 Deliverables


## Story point forecast

Following the [Yesterday's Weather](https://www.scruminc.com/yesterdays-weather/) concept, the team estimates we can complete **22** points in this sprint. 

This point value is based on our progress during [Sprint 1](../Sprint1) and [Sprint 2](../Sprint2), but takes into account the increased workload of team members other classes.

Last sprint, we completed 21 points. 

Due to increased workload in other classes and personal availability due to real-world circumstances, we estimated we would be able to complete 80% of the work we did last sprint.

21 points in a 2.5 week sprint boiled averaged out to 8.4 points / week.

Since we estimated we would be 90% as efficient this sprint as last sprint, we expect to accomplish 90% of the points per week. This comes to **7.5** points per week. 

Given our 1.5 week Sprint, we expect we will acomplish **11 points** this sprint.

We expect this number will become more accurate over time, as we have more Sprints to narrow down our velocity.

## Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration is still in place. Appropriate configuration files can be found in the [.github](../../.github) directory.

## Scrum

Scrums were conducted during this sprint. A [recording of one of these SCRUMs](https://kennesawedu.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/Team-Spring2023Group3SWE6733-EmergingSoftwareEngineeringProc/Shared%20Documents/General/Recordings/Meeting%20in%20_General_-20230411_200645-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?csf=1&web=1)
can be viewed as long as you are logged in with your KSU account.


## Pair programming

Pair programming was not used as often during this sprint due to time constaints and obligations outside of school. One quick pair-debugging session can be seen with your KSU account.
[The Pair Programming Session](https://kennesawedu.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/Team-Spring2023Group3SWE6733-EmergingSoftwareEngineeringProc/EfvRIrtvuwZEt4KSPWFcECoBC6WRVITCUSxL8CeVXE6tVQ?e=0cB2wZ) was shared by direct access. If you have trouble viewing, please let us know and we will send a link directly.

## Test-first

Unit tests can be found in the [API tests directory](api/tests/Feature/). To run the unit tests, follow the instructions in the [API README](api/README.md) to create a new API instance. By default, database connection is not allowed, so contact the team to gain access. Alternatively, you can set up a Neo4j database locally and connect the API to it.
An example of this running in Sprint e can be found in [unit_tests_sprint_3.png](unit_tests_sprint_3.png).


Behavior driven tests can be found in the [tests](../../tests) directory. There are several new and improved tests since the last sprint.
