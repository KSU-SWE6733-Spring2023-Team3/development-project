# Sprint 2 Deliverables


## Story point forecast

The team estimates we can complete **N** points in this sprint. This point value is based on our progress during [Sprint 1](../Sprint1), but takes into account the increased workload of team members other classes.

## Continuous Integration

The new requirement for Sprint 2 was to implement Continuous Integration. Appropriate configuration files can be found in the [ci](../../ci) directory. The review of CI tools we did can be found in [ci_tool_review.md](ci_tool_review.md).

## Sprint Burndown Chart

## Scrum



## Pair programming



## Test-first

Unit tests can be found in the [API tests directory](api/tests/Feature/RegistrationTest.php). To run the unit tests, follow the instructions in the [API README](api/README.md) to create a new API instance. By default, database connection is not allowed, so contact the team to gain access. Alternatively, you can set up a Neo4j database locally and connect the API to it.



Behavior driven tests can be found in the [tests](../../tests) directory.
