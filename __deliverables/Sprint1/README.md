# Sprint 1 Deliverables


## Story point forecast

The team estimates we can complete 20 points in this sprint. Since this work is mostly set-up and some initial design and decision making, we will most likely not have all team members as active as possible quite yet.

## Sprint Burndown Chart

The Sprint Burndown Chart was created using Zenhub, as Github Projects does not have a built-in burndown chart functionality.

The [burndown](burndown.png) screenshot is a screenshot of our burndown chart from Sprint 1, during which we were able to close out all but one of our planned stories.

## Scrum

Scrums were conducted asynchronously via messaging in our Microsoft Teams channel. We performed one SCRUM via video meet, but it seems the recording expired.

The [scrum](scrum.png) screenshot is an example of one of our daily scrums.

## Pair programming

Pair programming was done for the Behavior Driven Testing. [The link](https://kennesawedu.sharepoint.com/sites/Team-Spring2023Group3SWE6733-EmergingSoftwareEngineeringProc/Shared%20Documents/General/Recordings/Meeting%20in%20_General_-20230328_211641-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?web=1) to the video can be viewed as long as you are logged in with your Kennesaw account.

## Test-first

Unit tests can be found in the [API tests directory](api/tests/Feature/RegistrationTest.php). To run the unit tests, follow the instructions in the [API README](api/README.md) to create a new API instance. By default, database connection is not allowed, so contact the team to gain access. Alternatively, you can set up a Neo4j database locally and connect the API to it.
A screenshot of these running successfully can be seen at [unit-tests.png](unit-tests.png).


Behavior driven tests can be found in the [tests](../../tests) directory.
