# Definition of Ready
Definition of Ready:

A story will be considered “ready” when it has:
* A meaningful title
* A well-formatted User Story, following the Story Template
* Additional details that are helpful to people who will work the stories
* Well-defined tasking for the developers
* Estimated story points
* Clearly defined Acceptance Criteria
* Appropriate labels for easy management
* Scope is limited such that each story can be accomplished by a single person, unless deemed necessary by the entire development team. 

## Title
The title of a story should be short, but descriptive enough to convey what is being done to the Product Owner or development team.


## Story Points
Story points will be measured as a combination of Time and Complexity. 
Stories that will take significant Time but are not Complex can be rated as highly as stories that will not take as much Time but are more Complex. 
Stories will be estimated using [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). Our team is setting a limit of 5 points per story. If a story is estimated at more than 5 points, it needs to be broken down into simpler stories.
