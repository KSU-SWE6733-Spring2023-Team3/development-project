# development-project gui
Development project for KSU SWE 6733 Spring 2023 Team 3.    

This folder contains the React Native GUI for our development project. It was set up using a tabbed project template.

In order to run the project you'll need Expo CLI.

On Mac to install Expo you can run the following in terminal:
npm install -g expo-cli


Once you have Expo installed you can run the project by navigating to the base folder of the gui and running one of the following commands depending on which version of the app you'd like to run:

- npm run android
- npm run ios
- npm run web

Additionally you can install the Expo GO app on your phone to test the app directly on your phone. I haven't tried this myself but it seems pretty straightforward.
