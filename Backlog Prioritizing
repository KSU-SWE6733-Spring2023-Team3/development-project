The backlog was ordered by three criteria. The first criterion is functionality. The hierarchy is based on functionality. That is, the requirements are ordered based  
on how important they are based on their importance to the foundation of the functionality of the application. The highest priority are the platforms required for the  
App to run. Next, the most basic functions for creating and maintaining profiles. Then the most basic functions for matching people. After this, the functions that  
improve the match-making process. Finally, the “bells and whistles” that will make the App more appealing.  

The second criterion was the chronological order in which these tasks need to be accomplished. For instance, a registration page needs to be built before a login form  
because, logically, the login form needs an object to point to and that object would be generated by the registration page.  

Finally, in the case of a tie in both of the previous two criteria, the final criterion is story points, with the tasks being ordered in descending order.
